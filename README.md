# Platform for the semester project: Digital and Circular Project-based Learning Course FS2021

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Set up

For setting up the local development take the following steps:

# Visual Studio Code

https://code.visualstudio.com/

Visual Studio Code is a free source code editor from Microsoft. Visual Studio Code is available cross-platform for Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

After installing VS Code, open the parent folder where you want to store the code folder afterwards.

Recommendation: Store you Parent folder directly on you C

for example, create a folder

***C:\src***

**After the installation, open in VS Code the parent folder you created or want to use for the local development**

# NodeJS

Install NodeJS

https://nodejs.org/en/

For checking if it was working, type in your terminal window: `node -v`

# NPM package manager

Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm packages for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a terminal window.

# Angular CLI

You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

# Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

To install Git follow this link

https://git-scm.com/

# Github

After installing the above you can clone the repo, the src to you local environment. 

**Be sure where you want to store the repo. For example in the parent folder we created**

***C:\src***

open terminal and run

`git clone https://github.com/dabuchera/interdisciplinary-class.git` 

**After you cloned the repo to your local environment, take care that you open the correct folder.**

***C:\src\interdisciplinary-class***

## First start

## Local Development
